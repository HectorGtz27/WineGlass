# Design of a glass of wine for the Glass Industry

We designed a glass of wine based on various surveys and investigations that we carried out, based on these results we decided to make a glass of wine focused on people with the age range of 18 - 29 years. The wine glass design was developed in google colab with the python language. Libraries such as matplotlib, mpl_toolkits and math were used.
